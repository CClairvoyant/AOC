# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). 
It features a series of daily programming puzzles/challenges, released one each day in December, 
in the form of a two-part problem. Participants are encouraged to solve these puzzles using 
any programming language(s) of their choice.

## Solutions

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the Advent of Code problems. 
Each day's solution is organized into its own directory, named according to the day of the challenge.

## Folder Structure

## Usage

To run the solutions, place an input file `data.txt` in the directory of the day's solution
and install my utility package using the following command:

```bash
pip install utils-anviks
